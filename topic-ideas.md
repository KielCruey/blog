# Ideas
* ccmake and cmake-gui
    - other ways to visualize cmake via different GUIs
* general cmake language topics
    - variables
    - loops
    - if statements
* cmake -P is called "script mode", it informs CMake this file is not intended to have a project() command. We're not building any software, instead using CMake only as a command interpreter.
    * create a script
* cmake macros and functions
    * how do use them
* find_packages command
    - add other code/libraries and use them in your project
